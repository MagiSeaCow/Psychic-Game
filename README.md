Letter Guessing Game

This project is an attempt to create a game that:

1. Makes the computer generate a random alphabetical lower case letter from a-z.

2. Asks the user to guess what letter the computer has picked on random

3. Keeps score of how many guesses a user has, as well as keep track of how many times the computer has won vs how many times the computer has won

4. Be able to reset itself and start a new game after the user has exhausted all of their guesses.

The purpose of the project is to practice implementation of Javascript to a front end HTML, and have the user be able to interact with the front end HTML.

The game starts as soon as it is loaded in the browser.

Project is maintained by me (Xiao aka MagiSeaCow).
